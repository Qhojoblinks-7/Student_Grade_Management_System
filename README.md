## Introduction
The Student Management System is a C language project designed to manage student records for a high school or university. It allows administrators to add, edit, delete, and retrieve student information from a centralized database. The system is user-friendly and provides a command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Features
The project offers the following features:

- Add Student: Add a new student to the database with details such as name, date of birth, gender, address, contact number, and email.
- Display All Students: View the details of all students in the database.
- Edit Student: Modify the information of an existing student, including name, date of birth, gender, address, contact number, and email.
- Delete Student: Mark a student as inactive, removing them from active display without permanently deleting their data.
- Retrieve Inactive Students: Display information of students marked as inactive.
- Search Students: Search for students by student ID, name, or any other available information.
- Sort Students: Sort the students in the database based on various criteria, such as name, ID, or date of birth.
- Save to File: Save the student database to a file for future use or data backup.
- Load from File: Load a previously saved student database from a file.
- Automatic Backup: Automatically back up the student database at regular intervals to prevent data loss.
