## Introduction
The Student Management System is a C language project designed to manage student records for a high school or university. It allows administrators to add, edit, delete, and retrieve student information from a centralized database. The system is user-friendly and provides a command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Features
The project offers the following features:

1. **Add Student:** Add a new student to the database with details such as name, date of birth, gender, address, contact number, and email.
2. **Display All Students:** View the details of all students in the database.
3. **Edit Student:** Modify the information of an existing student, including name, date of birth, gender, address, contact number, and email.
4. **Delete Student:** Mark a student as inactive, removing them from active display without permanently deleting their data.
5. **Retrieve Inactive Students:** Display information of students marked as inactive.
6. **Search Students:** Search for students by student ID, name, or any other available information.
7. **Sort Students:** Sort the students in the database based on various criteria, such as name, ID, or date of birth.
8. **Save to File:** Save the student database to a file for future use or data backup.
9. **Load from File:** Load a previously saved student database from a file.
10. **Automatic Backup:** Automatically back up the student database at regular intervals to prevent data loss.
